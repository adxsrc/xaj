|XAJ|_: Numerical Integrators for |JAX|_
========================================

|XAJ|_ is a high performance numerical integration framework for
Google's |JAX|_.
The new programming interface is designed to make integration
composable with other |JAX|_ constructs such as just-in-time
compilation (``jit()``) and vectorization (``vmap()``).
Wrappers are available to make it compatible with
``scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()``.
