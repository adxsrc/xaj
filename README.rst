``XAJ``
=======

Numerical integrators for Google's |JAX|_.

``XAJ`` is a high performance numerical integration framework that
enables the implementations of advanced integrators for |JAX|_.
The programming interface is designed so it feels similar to the
derivative functions in |JAX|_.
Wrappers are available to make it compatible with
``scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()``.
