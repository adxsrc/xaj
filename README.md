# `XAJ`

Numerical integrators for Google's
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

`XAJ` is a high performance numerical integration framework that
enables the implementations of advanced integrators for JAX.
The programming interface is designed so it feels similar to the
derivative functions in `JAX`.
Wrappers are available to make it compatible with
`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()`.
